Traditional deployments are difficult, manual, and often break down, leading to employee burnout and unsustainable release cycles.
In comparison, recent research shows that using DevOps methodologies and principles like automation drives productivity and improves developer experience.
DevOps makes building and shipping software faster, friendlier, and more collaborative—and automates almost all of the process. Developers on DevOps teams focus on their goals,
prioritize work-life balance, and get more time for the projects they care about. This type of satisfaction builds on what we know from organizational psychology: 
Teams do their best work when they’re personally invested in the outcome.
